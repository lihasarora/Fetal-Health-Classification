In the past 30 years, the worldwide child mortality rate has decreased by 60%. While this is great progress, still in 2019 over 5 million children (about twice the population of Mississippi) died before reaching the age of 5-years old and half of these deaths were among newborns. To combat child mortality, the United Nations has set the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to reduce newborn mortality to 12 deaths per 1,000 live births by the end of 20301. For this, low-cost detection systems that can identify fetuses at high risk of death are required.

Fortunately, Cardiotocogram (CTG) can be used to collect vital information about fetal health during pregnancy, such as uterine contractions, fetal baseline heart rate (BHR), acceleration, deceleration, and variability of BHR at a low cost. CTGs as shown in figure 1, graph the fetal heart rate and uterine contraction as well as showing the relationship between the two. A normal BHR is 110-160 bpm and any heart rate outside of this range could suggest an abnormality. Abrupt increases/decreases in BHR are also abnormal and are described as accelerations/decelerations. Uterine contractions are assessed by the duration and intensity of the contraction with 2 in 10 minutes being normal2.

Objective

We built a classification model to predict if fetus health is at high risk solely based on data collected by the CTG and determine which variables are most important in making this prediction.

Our dataset consisted of the features derived from the output of a medical device called : CARDIOTOCOGRAM.
